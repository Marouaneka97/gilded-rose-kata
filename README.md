Refactoring of Kata : 
The simplest way is to just clone the code or download it in zip format, after that you can just unzip the projet.
With your editor (Inteliij or Eclipse) you can goto File and open the projet ( point to The unziped projet folder). after that the editor will sugest to run the code with (Gradle or Maven), you can choose the Gradle build, so all the missing dependecy will be intsalled. 

the "Item" class is moved to an new folder "item", wich contain all the new classe and interface used to refactor the code.

You will  find also a list of Junit tests added in class "GildedRoseTets" with the different cases, to simulate the behavior of code.
